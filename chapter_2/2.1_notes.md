Primative Built in (to CPP) types:
    - standard arithmetic types:
        - bool  = t/f

        - char = 8 bit characters
        - wchar_t = wide character
        - char16_t = 16 bit char
        - char32_t = 32 bit char
        
        - short = short int = 16 bit  < integer
        - int = integer = 26 - 32 bit integer
        - long = long integer = 32 - 64 bit integer
        - long long = very long integer = 64 bit integer  - intro'd in c++ 11
        
        - float = single - precision floating point = 6 sig digits
        - double = double - precision floating point = 10 sig digits
        - long double = extended precision floating point = 10 sig digits

    - Void type:
        - Has no associated values
        - most common usage - return type for functions that do not return a value.


    - signed vs unsigned types:
        - all integral types can be signed or unsigned (- vs +) EXCEPT bool (obvs)
        - signed = positive OR negative numbers incl zero
        - unsigned = only greater than zero

        - unlike integral types, there are 3 char types:
            - char =! unsigned Char
            - unsigned char =! char
            - signed char 

            - behaviour depends on compiler?

Rule of Thumb when pick type to assign:
    - use an unsigned type when you KNOW that a value cannot be negative
    - use INT not SHORT for integer arithmetic 
    - int and long often the same size in practice
    - if data is larger than the minimum size of an int use a long long
    - do nto use Char or Bool in arithmetic expressiond (duh)
    - arithmetic with char is troublesome, as signed vs unsigned depends on system.
    - if you need a tiny integer use either a signed char or an unsigned char
    - use a Double for floating point operations, Float does not usually have enough precision, and extra computation is neglible
    - precision offered by a long double is usually unessecary and involves much more computation.
