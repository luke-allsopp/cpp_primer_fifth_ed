Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
(d) int i = 3.14;



a) illegal, initialise input_value as 0 then read in input
b) defining i as integer, then initialising i as 3.14 -> will store as 3
c) illegal, wage is not defined. -> double wage = 9999.99, salary = wage;
d)  define the double 3.14 as an integer in i, -> storing as 3
