Conventions for Variable Names
 
There are a number of generally accepted conventions for naming variables. Following these conventions can improve the readability of a program.

 
• An identifier should give some indication of its meaning.

 
• Variable names normally are lowercase—index, not Index or INDEX.

 
• Like Sales_item, classes we define usually begin with an uppercase letter.

 
• Identifiers with multiple words should visually distinguish each word, for example, student_loan or studentLoan, not studentloan.
