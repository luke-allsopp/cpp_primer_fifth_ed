Exercise 2.10: What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

	std::string global_str;
	int global_int;
	int main()
	{
		int local_int;
		std::string local_str;
	}

global_str is a global string -> initial value is an empty string
global_int is a global integer -> initial value is 0
local_int is a local integer, and is not initialized -> initial value will be undefined
local_str is a local string, and is not initialized -> its value is determined by the global class std::string, therefore its initial value will be an empty string
