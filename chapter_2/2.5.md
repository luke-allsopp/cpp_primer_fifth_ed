Exercise 2.5: Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:

 
(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"

 
(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC

 
(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L

 
(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2


a) char literal, wide char literal, string literal, wide char string literal - diff b/w 1-2/3-4 == assigning type wchar_t

b) signed integer literal,  unsigned integer literal, signed long integer literal, unsigned long integer literal, signed octal literal, hexadecimal literal

c) floating point literal (double type), floating point literal (float type),  floating point literal (long type) 

d) integer literal signed type, unsigned integer literal, floating point double literal, floating point scientific notation double literal
