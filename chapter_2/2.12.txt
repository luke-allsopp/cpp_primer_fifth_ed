Exercise 2.12: Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
(a) int double = 3.14;
(b) int _;
(c) int catch-22;
(d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
(e) double Double = 3.14;


a) invalid - also type name for doubles, defined as int
b) invalid - identifier uses underscore outside of a function .
c) valid - but better name is catch_22 or catch22
d) valid
e) valid - but very confusing, as identifier uses capital D to id 3.14 as a double
