Exercise 2.17: What does the following code print?

    int i, &ri = i;
    i = 5; ri = 10;
    std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl;

- initializes i as a integer, creates ref to i &ri
- assigns 5 to i, then assigns 10 to ri (ref)
- prints both i and ri, 

print will be:
10 10

because when assigning value to reference, it assigns value to object referenced
