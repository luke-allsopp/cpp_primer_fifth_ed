Exercise 2.16: Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.

int i = 0, &r1 = i; 
double d = 0, &r2 = d;

(a) r2 = 3.14159;
(b) r2 = r1;
(c) i = r2;
(d) r1 = d;


All are valid assignments, however c and d will be truncated due to I being an int type
